#reading and writing files

#close -- Closes the file. Like File->Save.. in your editor.
#read -- Reads the contents of the file. You can assign the result to a variable.
#readline -- Reads just one line of a text file.
#truncate -- Empties the file. Watch out if you care about the file.
#write('stuff') -- Writes "stuff" to the file.

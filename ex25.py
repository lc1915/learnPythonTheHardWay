# even more practice

# Typing ex25. is annoying. A shortcut is to do your import like this: from ex25 import * which is like saying, "Import everything from ex25."

# Try doing this: help(ex25) and also help(ex25.break_words). Notice how you get help for your module, and how the help is those odd """ strings you put after each function in ex25? Those special strings are called documentation comments and we'll be seeing more of them.
